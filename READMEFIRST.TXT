This zip file contains the training data that you will be using in the Introduction to ECL and Introduction to THOR Online
Lessons. Save this file in a convenient location on your computer that you will remember, and in a subsequent lesson you 
will be instructed to upload the training data to your landing zone to be sprayed to your target cluster. Thank You!
